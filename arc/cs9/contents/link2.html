	<h1><center><font color="#ddd" face="Old English Text MT" size="7px">Cognitive functions</font></center></h1>
	<h2><font color="#ddd" face="Ink Free" size="6px"><b>About cognitive functions</font></b></h2>
	<p><font color="#ddd" face="Quicksand">
		Another way to type MBTI types is using cognitive functions, which were made based on Carl Jung's theories.
		In spite of being more complicated and confusing than dichotomies, and lacking scientific evidence, cognitive functions have become the more popular perception of MBTI.
	</font></p>
	<p><font color="#ddd" face="Quicksand">
		There are eight different functions.
		Four are extraverted functions (Te, Fe, Ne, Se) and four are introverted functions (Ti, Fi, Ni, Si).
		Four are judging (rational) functions (Te, Ti, Fe, Fi) and four are perceiving (irrational) functions (Ne, Ni, Se, Si).
		Everyone can be capable of using all eight functions, but typically only use their stack of four functions.
	</font></p>
	<p><font color="#ddd" face="Quicksand">
		The functions most commonly used by people are their dominant and auxiliary function—their first and second function.
		As people age and mature, their next two functions, the tertiary and inferior functions, are added.
	</font></p>
	<p><font color="#ddd" face="Quicksand">
		Some people also can develop functions outside of their four-function stack, which are called shadow functions.
		Shadow functions are opposite of their main functions—for example, if one has extraverted thinking as their first (dominant) function, then their first shadow function would be introverted thinking.
		The shadow functions also have names—extremely edgy names. In order, they are called the opposing, witch, trickster, and demon functions.
		While one can use any function, it is very important for one not to use weaker functions if these functions are not developed.
		Doing so, especially with the dangerous shadow functions, can cause one to make bad decisions, leading one to disaster and tragedy.
	</font></p>
	<h2><font color="#ddd" face="Ink Free" size="6px"><b>Each function</font></b></h2>
	<p><font color="#ddd" face="Quicksand">
		Extraverted thinking (Te), is an extraverted judging function.
		It is in the dominant spot of ENTJs and ESTJs, and the auxiliary spot of INTJs and ISTJs.
		People who use Te value efficiency, logic, and objectivity.
		Te users are often very good in leadership roles due to these qualities.
	</font></p>
	<p><font color="#ddd" face="Quicksand">
		Extraverted feeling (Fe), is another extraverted judging function.
		It is in the dominant spot of ENFJs and ESFJs, and the auxiliary spot of INFJs and ISFJs.
		People who use Fe have strong morals values that are formed by societal norms.
		Fe users are also very sensitive to others' feelings, being extremely empathetic and valuing harmony.
		However, in the wrong hands, Fe can also be used for less honorable purposes.
		Because Fe allows people to sense the emotions of others, it can be used to manipulate others.
		Adolf Hitler, a German dictator, is believed to be an INFJ, and he rose to power by using his auxiliary Fe to appeal to the hearts of the Germans.
