	<p><font color="#ddd" face="Quicksand">
		The easiest way to type using the Myer-Briggs Type Indicator is using dichotomies.
		Essentially, dichotomies are four sets of scales of preferences, shown by two different letters.
		These scales are:
	</font></p>
	<font color="#ddd" face="Quicksand"><ul>
		<li>Extraverted vs Introverted (E/I),</li>
		<li>iNtuition vs Sensing (N/S),</li>
		<li>Thinking vs Feeling (T/F), and</li>
		<li>Judging vs Perceiving (J/P).</li>
	</ul></font>
	<h2><font color="#ddd" face="Ink Free" size="6px"><b>Each scale</font></b></h2>
	<p><font color="#ddd" face="Quicksand">
		Firstly, the E/I scale shows how a person takes in information.
		An extravert takes in information and makes decisions based on things all around them, while an introvert focuses on single things, often within them.
		Because of this, extraverts are typically—though not always—more interactive, social, and outgoing than introverts.
	</font></p>
	<p><font color="#ddd" face="Quicksand">
		The second dichotomy is intuition and sensing.
		This is one of the more obscure properties that is often misunderstood.
		Simply stated, intuitives are curious and have a wandering mind that explores possibilities and visions of the future, while sensors are more grounded to this world, focusing on details and real things.
	</font></p>
	<p><font color="#ddd" face="Quicksand">
		<i>T</i> and <i>F</i> stand for <i>thinking</i> and <i>feeling</i>, respectively.
		Thinkers approach situations and make decisions with logic and objectivity, while feelers tend to use emotion and morality.
		<a href="https://www.slayerment.com/mbti-gender" target="_blank">Statistics</a> show that men are more likely to be thinkers, while women are more likely to be feelers.
	</font></p>
	<p><font color="#ddd" face="Quicksand">
		The last, and probably most confusing scale is the judging/perceiving scale.
		Judgers are generally more organized, decisive, and authoritative; perceivers are less confident and orderly.
		However, this scale is very hard to explain using dichotomies, but is extremely clear when shown with <a href="link2.html">cognitive functions</a>, so continue on to the next page!
